Capstone Project: Model Metrics Summary
Project Title: Assembling a 3-Peat Team (LA Dodgers 2025 Strategy)
Target Variable: Predicted xwOBA (Expected Weighted On-Base Average)
1. Model Overview
* Final Selected Model: Tuned Random Forest Regressor
* Modeling Goal: Predict the "Gold Standard" offensive performance (xwOBA) of MLB players to identify elite acquisition targets for the 2025 season.
2. Feature Set (Inputs)
The model uses the following high-correlation features to predict a player's true offensive value:
* Batted Ball Quality: exit_velocity_avg (EV), barrel_batted_rate (Barrel%), hard_hit_percent, avg_swing_speed.
* Plate Discipline: k_percent (K%), bb_percent (BB%), whiff_percent.
* Traditional Volume: pa (Plate Appearances), hit, home_run.
3. Model Hyperparameters (Tuned)
The model was optimized using GridSearchCV to prevent overfitting and ensure reliable predictions for new 2025 data:
* n_estimators: 200 (Number of trees in the forest)
* max_depth: 15 (Max levels in each decision tree)
* min_samples_split: 5
* random_state: 42 (For reproducibility)
4. Final Performance Metrics
Evaluated on a held-out Test Set (20% of data):
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0436
   * Interpretation: On average, the model's prediction of a player's xwOBA is accurate within ±.044 points. Given that a .400 xwOBA is elite and .320 is average, this is a very high level of precision.
* R-Squared (R²) Score: 0.6139
   * Interpretation: The model explains approximately 61.4% of the variance in a player's offensive output based solely on the input mechanics (swing speed, exit velocity, etc.).
5. Feature Importance (Top 3)
The model relies most heavily on these three factors when making a prediction:
1. Barrel%: (Highest impact on offensive success)
2. Exit Velocity: (Correlates strongly with extra-base hits)
3. K%: (The primary indicator of plate discipline stability)
